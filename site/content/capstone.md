## **The MS Business Analytics Capstone Course**

 **The Business Analytics capstone is the culminating experience of our Masters Program in Business Analytics. Students work in small groups, supervised by an experienced Faculty member, to provide data insights to client organizations.**
​
Skills you can expect to have within the team: Python, R, SQL, Statistics, Advanced analytics models and algorithms.

Students will also have specialized knowledge in areas such as end-user software (e.g. SAS or SPSS Modeler); Natural Language Processing; or Econometrics (time series).

Finally, being in the Masters program, our students have domain knowledge based on their undergraduate education and prior work experience. Many of our students come from an Engineering or a Finance background. We also have several student athletes.
